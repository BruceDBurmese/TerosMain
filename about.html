            <h2>My Experience During the Event</h2>
            <p>Being part of the LUX MUNDIS CUP 2024 especially being a candidate for the MR. and MS. TCGC 2024 for my institute; THE ICS, was a whirlwind adventure. Everyday was exhausting, practicing from daytime to sun down, midnight to be specific. It was not easy to be a candidate as there are so much pressure. When the night came, Sports Competition, Me and Erika practiced Taekwondo, because we decided to choose taekwondo as I am a taekwondo blackbelt already. So it was no hard for me to perform, the only thing is I am teaching her and it went out cool. We did not entered the top 3 but it was fine, it was our first time anyways.</p>

            <p>The Coronation night came, we were all so nervous. From the production number to the attire competitions, I did my best for my institute. I didnt include the Top 3, but I learned so much and It doesnt matter to me. The important thing is that I've learned things.</p>
